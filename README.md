## Problem statement:
As you know many of the people will visit new places, they use google maps as they donâ€™t know the route, we try to show predicted accident-prone areas present in that particular route which will could also be reported using the app by the users while they traversed that route. So that users can be aware and drive safely while entering these zones.
